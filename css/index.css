    Courtney Ferone - Project #1

    Design Direction:
    YOU CANNOT USE BOOTSTRAP (OR ANY FRONTEND FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROJECT).

    All assignments must be submitted as a zip file through blackboard that contains all elements necessary (HTML, CSS, Images, etc).

    Using HTML and CSS, create a personal website for yourself. The purpose of this site will be to act as a home page and portal and 
    should show off both your HTML and CSS skills along with telling a little bit about you.

    The site should have at least 3 pages. Each page should have navigation to get between each page.

    You should use at least one CSS file that gets included in the head of every page.

    There should be an HTML form on one of the pages of your site. It can be a contact form, an order form (for a fictitious product?) 
    â€” be creative. Be sure to use at least 5 form INPUTS (input, textarea, select, etc). The form MUST validate (not all fields are 
    required to validate).

    The form has to submit the data using method GET and passthrough values on the URL upon submitting.

    The below line must be added to the html file to reference this stylesheet: (must be located in the <head>   </head> tag)
        <link href="css/index.css" rel="stylesheet">
        link href="css/index.css": Tell the html file to reference the directory (folder) named css and use the index.css file
        rel="stylesheet": Tell the html file the .css file is a stylesheet
